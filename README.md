# DRL_Gongguan: Deep Reinforcement Learning for Gongguan Roundabout Traffic Control

This repository contains the code and configurations for training, evaluating, and analyzing deep reinforcement learning (DRL) agents on the Gongguan Roundabout using SUMO and Stable-Baselines3.
Environment: SUMO-based `GongguanRoundaboutEnv` :Observation, action and reward.  
Algorithms: Recurrent PPO, PPO and DDQN using Stable-Baselines3 and SB3-Contrib.  
Taffic demand, network, and environment for systematic experiments.
