# DRL_Gongguan: Deep Reinforcement Learning for Gongguan Roundabout Traffic Control

This repository contains the code, configurations, and experiment results for **deep reinforcement learning (DRL)** applied to **traffic signal control at the Gongguan Roundabout** using **SUMO** and **Stable-Baselines3**.

The objective of this project is to develop and evaluate DRL-based controllers, including **Recurrent PPO (RPPO)** and **PPO**, to reduce queue lengths, improve average speed, and minimize travel time under realistic traffic demand scenarios.

## üìç Gongguan Roundabout and SUMO Environment

Below is the real-world **Gongguan Roundabout** in Taipei, Taiwan, and its corresponding SUMO simulation environment used for DRL training and evaluation:

## üöÄ Training Results: RPPO vs PPO

The following plots show the **training curves of RPPO and PPO under the Gongguan Roundabout scenario**.

> **In all plots below: the orange line represents RPPO, and the blue line represents PPO.**

### Average Travel Time

These metrics collectively demonstrate the learning progression and performance differences between RPPO and PPO during training in the roundabout traffic control task.
